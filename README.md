# Data Warehouse Design Assignment - Fall 2023

This repository contains a comprehensive assignment for a Data Warehouse Course in Fall 2023. The purpose of this assignment is to design and manipulate a data warehouse for the University of Savannah at Richmond Hill (USRH) using data extracted from three different sources. The goal is to create a data warehouse that allows for the analysis of graduates based on various attributes such as majors, degrees, colleges, GPAs, semesters, and combinations thereof.

The assignment is divided into six parts:

1. #### **Data Integration:** Integrate data from the three sources while addressing format and semantic conflicts. Detailed explanations of actions taken and justifications are provided in a Project Report.

2. #### **Data Warehouse Design:** Design a data warehouse using a schema chosen from class materials. Justify the schema choice, identify dimensions, attributes, fact table, and hierarchy for each dimension. Diagrams illustrating the design are included in the Project Report.

3. #### **Data Warehouse Implementation:** Create the data warehouse using MySQL, populate it with integrated data, and explain the mechanism for extracting "facts" from the integrated data. Details and justifications are documented in the Project Report.

4. #### **OLAP Interface Development:** Develop an interface for the data warehouse using a programming language of choice to mimic an OLAP system. The interface guides users in constructing queries in OLAP operations and generates corresponding SQL statements for execution in MySQL.

5. #### **Query Testing:** Test the OLAP interface by implementing four queries using OLAP operations. Document the queries in plain English, OLAP operations, SQL statements generated by the interface, and the outcomes produced by MySQL. Screenshots of MySQL outcomes are included.

6. #### **Project Report and Submission:** Compile a comprehensive Project Report including a cover page, table of contents, table of figures, introduction, and conclusion. Program codes are included in an appendix. The assignment has multiple submission deadlines, with the final submission due on November 27, 2023.

Additionally, there will be private Zoom meetings for project demonstrations on November 29 and December 24, where the instructor will provide plain English queries, and students will use the OLAP interface to generate SQL codes and display outcomes from MySQL. Failure during these meetings can impact the final exam score.

This repository serves as a guide for completing the assignment and contains relevant documentation and code.

For any questions or clarifications, please contact the instructor.
